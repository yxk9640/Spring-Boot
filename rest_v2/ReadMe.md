# Basic Spring Restful Web Service Project

## Overview

This project is developed using Spring Boot framework and incorporates various features and best practices to build robust and scalable web applications.

## Implemented Tasks

### Dispatcher Servlets

- Handles incoming requests and forwards them to the appropriate controller.
- Configuration is done using Spring Boot AutoConfiguration.

### DAO (Data Access Object) / Repository

- Manages data flow to and from the database.

### REST Services

- Implements RESTful services, including POST operations.
- Provides appropriate responses to indicate changes in the application.

### Exception Handling

- Customizes exception handling to enhance user experience.
- Utilizes 404 for user not found instead of the default 401.

### Validation

- Utilizes validation annotations provided by Spring Boot Starter Web.

### HATEOAS (Hypermedia As Engine of Application State)

- Enhances API discoverability by providing links to related resources.

### Internationalization (I18N)

- Implements localization for responses based on client location.

### Content Negotiation

- Handles representation of data in different formats like XML, JSON, and Text.

### Documentation using Swagger

- Documents APIs for client reference using Swagger-3 and custom descriptions.

### Filter API

- Allows dynamic filtering of fields based on client requirements.

### Versioning

- Supports multiple ways of versioning APIs, including header options, request parameters, and headers.

### Security

- Implements basic authentication and discusses other security options like Digest Authentication and OAuth.

### JPA (Java Persistence API)

- Utilizes JPA for object-relational mapping and database access.

### Defining Relationships

- Defines relationships between entities and manages lazy loading to optimize performance.

### Errors and Debugging

- Discusses common errors and debugging techniques.

### Best Practices

- Includes a consumer-first approach, proper documentation, correct usage of HTTP methods and status codes, and naming conventions for resources and exceptions.

### Application Flow

- Describes the flow from client to database, involving resource classes, DAOs, and database operations.
